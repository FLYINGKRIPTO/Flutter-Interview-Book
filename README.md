# FLUTTER INTERVIEW BOOK

1. ### Explain isolates and How isolates run on event loop?
2. ### How isolates shares data?
3. ### Compare `Isolate.spawn` and `compute`  method.
4. ### What is Skia? 
    
    Skia is an open-source 2D graphics library that is used to render graphics and text in a variety of environments, including Flutter.

    Skia provides a complete solution for 2D graphics, including vector graphics, raster graphics, and text rendering. It supports a wide range of             platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux, and it can be used on various hardware configurations, from low-end embedded systems to       high-performance desktop machines.

   Flutter uses Skia as its primary rendering engine to draw the graphical elements on the screen. When you build a Flutter app, the Flutter framework        compiles the Dart code into native code and uses Skia to render the graphics.

   Skia is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, and it provides a rich set of features that are useful for creating high-quality, responsive, and    visually appealing applications. Because Skia is an open-source project, developers can easily contribute to its development and make modifications to      the library if necessary.

5. ### Why is Impeller introduced as new Flutter Engine and what is the difference between skia and impeller?
6. ### What are keys in flutter and discuss there usage?
7. ### What is the difference between `async` and `async*`?
   
   In Dart, the difference between async and async* lies in the type of functions they define and the way they handle asynchronous operations.

   An async function is a function that is marked as asynchronous and can be used to perform asynchronous operations. It returns a Future object, which       represents a value that will be available at some point in the future. An async function can be used to perform operations such as reading from a file,     making an HTTP request, or waiting for a timer to complete.

    An async* function, on the other hand, is a generator function that is marked as asynchronous. It allows you to yield values as they become available,      rather than waiting for all the results to be available before returning a single value. This is useful when working with large collections of data or      when performing operations that can produce a large number of results. An async* function returns a Stream object, which is a sequence of asynchronous      events.

   In summary, the main difference between async and async* is that async functions return a single Future value, while async* functions return a Stream of    values. async functions are useful when you want to perform a single asynchronous operation and wait for the result, while async* functions are useful      when you want to perform multiple asynchronous operations and yield results as they become available.

- When is didChangeDependency Called?
	- **didChangeDependencies()**Â is called when a dependency of the State object changes or immediately afterÂ **initState()**
	- **didChangeDependencies**Â may be called multiple times per widget lifecycle ,it was called when the keyboard appears/disappears
	- `initstate`Â is called before the state loads its dependencies.
- When is didUpdateWidget called?
- vsync
	- Vsync basically keeps the track of screen, so that Flutter does not renders the animation when the screen is not being displayed.
- Ticker, SingleTickerProviderMixin, TickerProviderMixin
- Difference between Image.asset and AssetImage
	- `Image`Â is aÂ `StatefulWidget`Â andÂ `Image.asset`Â is just a named constructor, you can use it directly on your widget tree.
	- `AssetImage`Â is anÂ `ImageProvider`Â which is responsible for obtaining the image of the specified path.
	- If you check the source code of theÂ `Image.asset`Â you will find that it's using AssetImage to get the image.


# Flutter Practical Questions

### 1. In what sequence values will be printed in the following code snippet?

```
void main() async {
  print(await name());
  print(await city());
  print(await status());
  print(await job());
}

Future<String> name() async => "Rocky";
Future<String> city() => Future.value("Kolar");
Future<String> status() async {
  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
  return "Drowning";
}
Future<String> job() => Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1), () => "Don"); 

```

Answwer -> 
Rocky
Kolar
Drowning
Don

The function `status()` is an async fuction but await hasn't been used there and hence the 2 seconds delay doesn't mean anything.

### 2. What is the difference between the following code lines? 

```
Future<String> job() => Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1), () => "Don");
Future<String> hobby() async => Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1), () => "Shooting");

```

Answer -> 
`async` word doesn't make any differene here.
